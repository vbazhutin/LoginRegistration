## Capstone project

Well, the idea of the projects is - A website service that helps people get hired for a specific company. The way i came for the idea, so i was a supervisor for a company that was doing work for Spectrum(Charter Communications). I was also handling hiring process which was ~~screwed up~~ in a really bad state. So the main details:
- A responsive, well designed website
- The website should include multiple features that would help employees and employer to cut time and have a better understand of each other such.
- Map API
- Login form for the employee to edit data
- Structured data for every locations
